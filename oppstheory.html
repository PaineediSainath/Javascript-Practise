There are four main pillars of OOP:
<!--  -->
Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and related
behaviors (methods) into a single unit called an object. The object encapsulates
the data and provides controlled access to it through methods. It helps in
hiding the internal implementation details and provides abstraction.
<!--  -->
Inheritance: Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and behaviors from
other objects. It enables code reuse and the creation of hierarchical
relationships between classes. Inheritance promotes the concept of "is-a"
relationship, where a subclass inherits from a superclass. Subclasses can extend
and override the functionality of the superclass.
<!--  -->
Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as
objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface to
represent different types of objects. Polymorphism can be achieved through
method overriding (having different implementations of a method in subclasses)
and method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different
parameters).
<!--  -->
Abstraction: Abstraction involves focusing on essential features while hiding
unnecessary details. It allows us to create abstract classes or interfaces that
define the common behavior and characteristics of related objects. Concrete
classes implementing these abstractions provide the specific implementation
details.
